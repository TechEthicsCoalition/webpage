The Tech Ethics Coalition (TEC) connects people working in the NYC tech industry. Together we address the social, political, economic, and moral issues related to the current and future state of our industry. Topics include data collection and privacy, machine learning and bias, emerging regulation and oversight, and more.

## Our Vision
We are the leading resource for local government, media, and industry to ask questions about tech ethics. We are a model for other groups around the country.

## Our Values
We value technological innovation, but not at all costs. We also value societyâ€™s right to be free from harms caused by the uncritical use of data and machine learning technologies.

## Our Overarching Goal
Protecting individuals and communities from the harms caused by the uncritical use of data and machine learning technologies.
