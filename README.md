TO DO

# Known issues
- Reorder menu items? (controlled by line 5 of /layouts/partials/menu.html)
- Demo blog: The ‘posts’ (blog) section contains dummy content for now—as demo. (The website is set up so we can easily remove the blog section from the menu for the initial launch, and add it back with our own content later when we’re ready to have stuff out there.)  
- About: The content of the "about" page needs to be updated with our current value + goals.


# Issues TBD (group input?)
- Subtitle for the homepage (and possibly for the large logo)? (Quick one-line way to communicate who we are; perhaps should mention NYC.)
- Color scheme? Currently using monochrome defaults. (Easy to tweak.)
- Domain name? Currently using a github.io address. We could consider getting our own (shorter) domain name.
- Menu sections + names? We currently have generic descriptive names: "about" (who we are + values + goals), "join" (contact, reach us, join us, etc), "events" (events we organize (past and future)), "blog" (for the upcoming blog).
